# Description
Hi! I am an applied mathematician/statistician wanting to learn more about the world of DS and CS.
This is a project I did during one of my master's classes where we analyzed a single-cell RNA-seq dataset.
My part in this project was to do the dimensionality reduction and data processing.

## Dataset overview
The data set has 78 rows (patients) 4949 columns with 4948 gene expression measurements of cancer tissue, each column representing a ‘gene’ with column 4949 having the information of a class variable with two values: 1 and 2.
